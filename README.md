# Conway-game-of-life

This is my first project -- Based on Conway's Game of Life

Rules:
1.) Any living cell with less than 2 neighbours dies\n
2.) Any living cell with more than 3 neighbours dies\n
3.) Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours revives (comes to life)\n
4.) Any dead cell with exactly 2 neighbours has a 0.01% chance to revive (My own addition)\n
5.) Any living cell with 2 or 3 neighbours survives to the next generation\n

Any improvements will be helpful
