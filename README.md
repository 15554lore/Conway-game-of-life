# Conway-game-of-life

This is my first project -- Based on Conway's Game of Life

Rules:

1.) Any living cell with less than 2 neighbours dies

2.) Any living cell with more than 3 neighbours dies

3.) Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours revives (comes to life)

4.) Any dead cell with exactly 2 neighbours has a 0.01% chance to revive (My own addition)

5.) Any living cell with 2 or 3 neighbours survives to the next generation

Any improvements will be helpful
