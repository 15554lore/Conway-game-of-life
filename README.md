# Conway-game-of-life

This is my first project -- Based on Conway's Game of Life

Rules:
1.) Any living cell with less than 2 neighbours dies
2.) Any living cell with more than 3 neighbours dies
3.) Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours revives (comes to life)
4.) Any dead cell with exactly 2 neighbours has a 0.01% chance to revive (My own addition)
5.) Any living cell with 2 or 3 neighbours survives to the next generation

Any improvements will be helpful
